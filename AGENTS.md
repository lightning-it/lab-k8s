# Engineering agent contract

This repository contains public Kubernetes laboratory manifests and runbooks. Treat
`.lit/repository.yml`, `RELEASE.md`, `TESTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, and the accepted
Lightning IT Engineering ADRs as the governing repository contract.

- Work through a pull request into `develop`; promote reviewed `develop` to `main`.
- Never commit kubeconfigs, tokens, private keys, credentials, or production data.
- Validate YAML structure, Kubernetes manifests, and documented smoke tests.
- Keep external GitHub Actions pinned to full commit SHAs and permissions
  least-privilege.
- Preserve managed-file headers and change shared policy at
  `lightning-it/shared-assets-lit`.
- Run `python3 scripts/lit-push-ready.py push-ready` before pushing.
- Required remote checks and branch protection must not be bypassed.
- ADR 70 temporarily allows zero human/CODEOWNER approvals and separately
  documented protected-environment self-approval for immutable exact-SHA
  plan/apply evidence; it does not allow PR self-review or check bypass.

<!-- LIT AI task governance: start -->

## AI model and token governance

Apply `LIT-GEN-GDR-GOV-30-Budget-Conscious-AI-Model-Selection` to every
substantive Codex or ChatGPT-assisted task. Before investigation, planning, tool
use, implementation, or delegation, record a compact task profile in the task
chat: work item, risk (`low`, `normal`, or `high`), smallest sufficient
model/reasoning choice, rationale, and a concrete escalation condition.

- Use the balanced, lowest reliable capability by default. Escalate to a
  premium/frontier model or higher reasoning only for a high-risk decision,
  complex architecture/debugging/dependencies, or a documented focused failure
  of the standard approach. Restrict that escalation to the difficult subtask.
- Never use Speed Mode. Do not replace verification with a more expensive model
  or sacrifice quality to reduce elapsed time.
- Retrieve only relevant issue, files, logs, and source records; avoid broad
  repository or chat-history loading, speculative analysis, and unbounded retry
  loops. Delegate only independent, bounded work that reduces total effort.
- For GitHub or Jira work, include the task profile in the issue/task record
  when AI assistance materially affects execution. Close with verification and
  remaining risks; preserve durable decisions in Confluence, Jira, or GitHub.
